# whats-the-weather

This application is a weather dashboard that helps users search for the current weather of a specific city.

A user can search for their desired city into the text input area.
A user can then see the name of the location, the date and the current weather for that location.
A user will also see the forcast for the next following 5 days.
A user search history is persisted on the page upon later visits so that they can click to view weather in past cities they have searched or delete past searched cities.

This application uses the OpenWeather API to render the date and the updated current weather and 5 day weather forcast for the given city a user seacrhes.
